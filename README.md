Convoluted Attention
==============

This repo contains code accompanying the paper 
"Increasing Learning Efficiency of Self-Attention Networks through
 Direct Position Interactions, Learnable Temperature, 
 and Convoluted Attention".

Usage
--------

Requirements are in `requirements.txt`. To run it on GPU, CUDA 10.0 is required (the code is already old).
